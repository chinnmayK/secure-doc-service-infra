# Secure Document Processing & Metadata Service

This project demonstrates a cost-optimized AWS architecture for running
a private document-processing service using EC2, ALB, Auto Scaling,
NAT Gateway, and local log management.

Infrastructure is provisioned using Terraform.
Backend service is a real Flask application.

Phases are committed incrementally to reflect real-world delivery.
